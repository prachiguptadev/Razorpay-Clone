Hey, take a look at our  Razorpay website clone! 
It's a  popular online payments platform in India. we made it  using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I cloned the frontend part of the official Razorpay website.
And I face many challenges while making UI. This project helped me learn various styling concepts and allowed me to recreate the UI with precision.
